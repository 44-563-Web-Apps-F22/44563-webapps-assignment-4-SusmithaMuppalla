        <p>I know a youth who loves a little maid—
            (Hey, but his face is a sight for to see!)
       Silent is he, for he's modest and afraid—
            (Hey, but he's timid as a youth can be!)</p>

<h6>ROSE.</h6>   <p>I know a maid who loves a gallant youth,
            (Hey, but she sickens as the days go by!)
       She cannot tell him all the sad, sad truth—
            (Hey, but I think that little maid will die!)</p>
   <h6>ROB.</h6>            <p> Poor little man!</p>

   <h6>ROSE</h6>           <p>  Poor little maid!</p>

<h6>ROSE.</h6>              <p> Poor little maid!</p>

<h6>BOTH.</h6>    <p> Now tell me pray, and tell me true,
       What in the world should the (young man\maiden) do?</p>

<h6>ROB.</h6>     <p> He cannot eat and he cannot sleep—
            (Hey, but his face is a sight for to see!)
       Daily he goes for to wail—for to weep—
            (Hey, but he's wretched as a youth can be!)</p>

<h6>ROSE.</h6>    <p> She's very thin and she's very pale—
            (Hey, but she sickens as the days go by!)
       Daily she goes for to weep—for to wail—
            (Hey, but I think that little maid will die!)</p>

<h6>BOTH.</h6>    <p> Now tell me pray, and tell me true,
       What in the world should the (young man\maiden) do?</p>

<h6>ROSE.</h6>     <p>If I were the youth I should offer her my name—
            (Hey, but her face is a sight for to see!)</p>

<h6>ROB.</h6>     <p>If were the maid I should fan his honest flame—
            (Hey, but he's bashful as a youth can be!)</p>

<h6>ROSE.</h6>    <p> If I were the youth I should speak to her to-day—
            (Hey, but she sickens as the days go by!)</p>

<h6>>ROB.</h6>      <p>If I were the maid I should meet the lad half way—
            (For I really do believe that timid youth will
                 die!)</p>

            I'll tell that (youth\maid) what (he\she) ought to
                 do!</p>
