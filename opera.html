    <h3>act 1  The fishing village of Rederring (in Cornwall).  Rose
        Maybud's cottage is seen L.</h3>
        <p>I know a youth who loves a little maid—
            (Hey, but his face is a sight for to see!)
       Silent is he, for he's modest and afraid—
            (Hey, but he's timid as a youth can be!)</p>

<h6 class="name">ROSE.</h6>   <p>I know a maid who loves a gallant youth,
            (Hey, but she sickens as the days go by!)
       She cannot tell him all the sad, sad truth—
            (Hey, but I think that little maid will die!)</p>
   <h6 class="name">ROB.</h6>            <p class="speech"> Poor little man!</p>

<h6 class="name">BOTH.</h6>    <p class="speech"> Now tell me pray, and tell me true,
       What in the world should the (young man\maiden) do?</p>

<h6 class="name">ROB.</h6>     <p class="speech"> He cannot eat and he cannot sleep—
            (Hey, but his face is a sight for to see!)
       Daily he goes for to wail—for to weep—
            (Hey, but he's wretched as a youth can be!)</p>

<h6 class="name">ROSE.</h6>    <p class="speech"> She's very thin and she's very pale—
            (Hey, but she sickens as the days go by!)

<h6 class="name">BOTH.</h6>     <p>I thank you, (miss\sir), for your counsel true;
            I'll tell that (youth\maid) what (he\she) ought to
                 do!</p>
                 <h6>ROB.</h6>  <p>Poor child!  I sometimes think that if she wasn't
  quite so particular I might venture—but no, no—even then I
  should be unworthy of her!</p>

                  <p>(He sits desponding.  Enter Old Adam.)</p>

       <h6 class="name">ADAM.</h6> <p> My kind master is sad!  Dear Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd—</p>
       <h6 class="name">ROB.</h6>  <p>Hush! As you love me, breathe not that hated name.
  Twenty years ago, in horror at the prospect of inheriting that
  hideous title, and with it the ban that compels all who succeed
  to the baronetcy to commit at least one deadly crime per day, for
  life, I fled my home, and concealed myself in this innocent
  village under the name of Robin Oakapple.  My younger brother,
  Despard, believing me to be dead, succeeded to the title and its
  attendant curse.  For twenty years I have been dead and buried.
  Don't dig me up now.</p>
      <h6 class="name"> ADAM. </h6><p class="speech"> Dear master, it shall be as you wish, for have I not
  sworn to obey you for ever in all things?  Yet, as we are here
  alone, and as I belong to that particular description of good old
  man to whom the truth is a refreshing novelty, let me call you by
  your own right title once more!  (Robin assents.)  Sir Ruthven
  Murgatroyd!  Baronet!  Of Ruddigore!  Whew!  It's like eight
  hours at the seaside!</p>
      <h6 class="name"> ROB.</h6> <p class="speech"> My poor old friend!  Would there were more like you!
       <h6 class="name">ADAM.</h6>  Would there were indeed!  But I bring you good
  tidings.  Your foster-brother, Richard, has returned from
  sea—his ship the Tom-Tit rides yonder at anchor, and he himself
  is even now in this very village!</p>
      <h6 class="name"> ROB.</h6>  <p class="speech">My beloved foster-brother?  No, no—it cannot be!
       ADAM.  It is even so—and see, he comes this way!</p>
                                               <p> (Exeunt together.)</p>

                      <p class="direction"> (Enter Chorus of Bridesmaids.)</p>

                                   <h6 class="name">.CHORUS</h6>

           <p class="song"> From the briny sea
                 Comes young Richard, all victorious!
            Valorous is he—
                 His achievements all are glorious!
            Let the welkin ring
            With the news we bring
                 Sing it—shout it—
                 Tell about it—
            Safe and sound returneth he,
            All victorious from the sea!</p>

 <p class="directions"> (Enter Richard.  The girls welcome him as he greets old
       acquaintances.)</p>

                        <h6 class="name"> CHORUS.</h6>       <p class="song"> So we made for the bold Mounseer,
                      D'ye see?
                 We made for the bold Mounseer.

            But she proved to be a Frigate—and she up with her
                 ports,
                 And fires with a thirty-two!
                      It come uncommon near,
                      But we answered with a cheer,
                 Which paralysed the Parley-voo,
                           D'ye see?
                 Which paralysed the Parley-voo!</p>

  <h6 class="name">CHORUS.</h6>       <p class="song"> Which paralysed the Parley-voo,
                           D'ye see?
                 Which paralysed the Parley-voo!

            Then our Captain he up and he says, says he,
                 "That chap we need not fear,—
                      We can take her, if we like,
                      She is sartin for to strike,
                 For she's only a darned Mounseer,
                           D'ye see?
                 She's only a darned Mounseer!"</p>

  <h6 class="name">CHORUS.</h6>        <p class="song">For she's only a darned Mounseer,
                           D'ye see?
                 She's only a darned Mounseer!

            "But to fight a French fal-lal—it's like hittin' of a
                 gal!
                 It's a lubberly thing for to do;
                      For we, with all our faults,
                      Why, we're sturdy British salts,
                 While she's only a Parley-voo,
                           D'ye see?
                 While she's only a poor Parley-voo!"</p>

 <h6 class="name"> CHORUS.</h6>       <P class="song"> While she's only a Parley-voo,
                           D'ye see?
                 While she's only a poor Parley-voo!'

            So we up with our helm, and we scuds before the breeze
                 As we gives a compassionating cheer;
                      Froggee answers with a shout
                      As he sees us go about,
                 Which was grateful of the poor Mounseer,
                           D'ye see?
                 Which was grateful of the poor Mounseer!</P>

  <h6 class="name">CHORUS.</h6>       <p class="speech"> Which was grateful of the poor Mounseer,
                           D'ye see?
                 Which was grateful of the poor Mounseer!

            And I'll wager in their joy they kissed each other's
                 cheek
                 (Which is what them furriners do),
                      And they blessed their lucky stars
                      We were hardy British tars
                 Who had pity on a poor Parley-voo,
                           D'ye see?
                 Who had pity on a poor Parley-voo!</p>

       <h6 class="name">RICH.</h6>  <p class="speech">Why, lord love ye, Rob, that's but a trifle to what
  we have done in the way of sparing life!  I believe I may say,
  without exaggeration, that the marciful little Tom-Tit has spared
  more French frigates than any craft afloat!  But 'taint for a
  British seaman to brag, so I'll just stow my jawin' tackle and
  belay. (Robin sighs.)  But 'vast heavin', messmate, what's
