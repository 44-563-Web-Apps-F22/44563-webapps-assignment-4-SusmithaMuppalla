<body>  <h6 class="name">RUTH.</h6>  <p class="speech">This is, perhaps, the only village in the world that
    possesses an endowed corps of professional bridesmaids who are
    bound to be on duty every day from ten to four—and it is at
    least six months since our services were required.  The pious
    charity by which we exist is practically wasted!</p>
         <h6 class="name">ZOR.</h6> <p class="speech"> We shall be disendowed—that will be the end of it!
    Dame Hannah—you're a nice old person—you could marry if you
    liked.  There's old Adam—Robin's faithful servant—he loves you
    with all the frenzy of a boy of fourteen.</p>
    <h6 class="name">HAN.</h6>  <p class="speech">Nay—that may never be, for I am pledged!</p>
        <h6 class="name"> ALL.</h6>  <p class="direction">To whom?</p>
        <h6> HAN.</h6> <p class="speech"> To an eternal maidenhood!  Many years ago I was
    betrothed to a god-like youth who woo'd me under an assumed name.
    But on the very day upon which our wedding was to have been
    celebrated, I discovered that he was no other than Sir Roderic
    Murgatroyd, one of the bad Baronets of Ruddigore, and the uncle
    of the man who now bears that title.  As a son of that accursed
    race he was no husband for an honest girl, so, madly as I loved
    him, I left him then and there.  He died but ten years since, but
    I never saw him again.</p>
    <h6 class="name">ZOR.</h6> <p class="speech">But why should you not marry a bad Baronet of
    Ruddigore?</p>
    <h6 class="name">RUTH.</h6>  <p class="speech">All baronets are bad; but was he worse than other</p>
    baronets?
    <p class="direction">(Enter Rose Maybud from cottage, with small basket on her arm.)</p>

      <h6> HAN.</h6>  <p class="speech">Whither away, dear Rose?  On some errand of charity,
  as is thy wont?</p>
      <h6> ROSE</h6>. <p class="speech"> A few gifts, dear aunt, for deserving villagers.  Lo,
  here is some peppermint rock for old gaffer Gadderby, a set of
  false teeth for pretty little Ruth Rowbottom, and a pound of
  snuff for the poor orphan girl on the hill</p>
